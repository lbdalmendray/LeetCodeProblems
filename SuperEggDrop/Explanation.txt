Explanation of My Solution : 

P(K,N) : Solution to the Problem with K eggs and N floors 
--- ( Originally N>=1 , but I use the N>=2 , because for me the 0 floor is important and at least any cut has 
2 floor)

Theorem 1 :
-----------

P(1,N) = N-1 

Proof :

If there are just 1 egg , the only way is to begin in 
the 2nd floor: ( the First floor could not be reached )
-- if it breaks then the first is the floor F 
-- if it does not break then the 2nd floor or any other floor over 2nd could be the F floor.
-- Do the same to the next floor (3rd,4th,...,N)
The answer is what happend if one the possibility is the Nth the F floor ,
then is necessary to pass from bottom to top . = N-1 floors . 

Theorem 2 :
-----------
P(K,N) <= P(K,N+1)

Proof :

- P(1,N) <= P(1,N+1) base on the Theorem 1. 
-  N-1   <=   N  

Demonstration by the absurd 
Think that there exist a K that the Theorem 2 is false . 
For K = M is the first value that the Theorem 2 is false.  

- For K = M >=1  
- P(K,N) > P(K,N+1) --- ( by the absurd ) 

Think that P(K,N+1) has a first floor to cut from the 1 to N+1 

If it is a floor from 1 to N , then in the P(K,N) we could cut in that place

cutFloor = i

- P(K,N+1) = Max ( P(K,N+1 - i ), P(K,i) )

- P( K, N) <= Max ( P(K,N - i )  , P(K,i) ) because Max ( P(K,N - i )  , P(K,i) )
is a possible solution of the problem of K eggs and N floors . 

knowing that  P(K,N - i ) <= P(K,N+1 - i) then 

P(K,N)<= P(K,N+1)  => K=M does not exist . 

Theorem 3 :
-----------
- P(K,N) <= P(K-1,N)

Proof : 

This is evident because :

- P(K,N) by definition is the solution of the problem with K eggs and N floor,
then if we don't use one of the eggs then we have that P(K,N) has as one of the 
possibilities P(K-1,N) => P(K,N) <= Min { Possibility1 , Possibility2 ,...,PossibilityK }
Possibility1 = P(K-1,N) => P(K,N) <= P(K-1,N)

Theorem 4 :
-----------

 ( P(K,N) ^ ( K >= i ) ) => P(K,N) == i
with i is the minimum value that 2^i >= N

Proof :
