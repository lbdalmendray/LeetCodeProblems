On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at (0, 0) and faces north. The robot can receive one of three instructions:

"G": go straight 1 unit;
"L": turn 90 degrees to the left;
"R": turn 90 degrees to the right.
The robot performs the instructions given in order, and repeats them forever.

Return true if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.

My Solution Explanation : 
-------------------------

My idea :
It does not matter how many instructions we have . What it matter is that when you execute all 
the instructions you will get a new position (possibly different from the (0,0)) and new Direction.
If we calculate that new state = ( position and Direction ),What are the cases to solve :

case1 : positon == (0,0) That means that all the operation will not change my position never , that 
means that all the circles with radio > 0 will have inside forever the robot .

case2 : Direction == Up and position != (0,0) that means that we will be changing forever the position 
with the same value . Imaging that we change the position with deltaChanging value
(dx,dy) , and because the new Direction is the same as the initial Direction that is Up , we will change 
the position with the same (dx,dy) value producing a new position (dx+dx,dy+dy) . When we repeat this
n times we will have a new position ( n*dx, n*dy) . If we think that exist a Circle with radio R that will
have ever the Robot there that is false , because we always could find a n = n0 that n*dx > R || n*dy > R 

case 3 : Direction == Right and position != (0,0) , Basically, what we have to show is that we are moving
in 4 steps , and the Robot will always return to the (0,0) and another way to show is that the Robot will be 
moving in an Square shape path . My math formulas explanation is this one :

Think that we have a general position (x,y) and we apply the instruccions then we obtain a delta position
and a new Direction . 

To calculate the delta position we have a function Delta(x,y) = ( x + dx , y + dy ) with dx > 0 || dy > 0 and constants values 
For the next step we have a new Direction an our new movement will be related to this Direction .
We will try to see this new state as the original Direction = Up . we can find a transformation matrix that change 
this new position and direction to equivalent with Direction == Up again .
To calculate the transformation we have a function Trans(x,y) = (-y , x) . This transformation means what we do 
if we try to see the Right direction as the Up direction that is that every x value in Up direction will be an y value for 
the Right direction and every y value with Up direction will be -x value that is the same to say that every -y value in Up will be the 
x positive value for Right . 

With this information , we can find a simple function that calculate a Delta and then transform Right values 
to Up values . Lets call this function F(x,y) , 
then
F(x,y) = Trans(Delta(x,y)) 
F(x,y) = Trans(x+dx , y + dy )  
------------------------------
| F(x,y) = (-y - dy, x + dx) |
------------------------------

Lets apply this 4 times to any point (x,y)
Step1
 F(x,y) = (-y- dy , x + dx )
Step2
 F(-y-dy, x + dx) = ( - x - dx - dy , -y - dy + dx )
Step3
 F( - x - dx - dy , -y - dy + dx ) = ( y + dy - dx - dy , - x - dx - dy + dx ) 
= ( y - dx , - x - dy )
Step4
 F( y - dx , - x - dy ) = ( x + dy - dy , y - dx + dx  )
= ( x , y) 
It shows that we return to the same point with 4 steps . Then knowing that this amount of instructions
in 4 steps is finite then the distance obtained is finite, lets call this distance d . Then any circle with radio 
r > d , with center (0,0) will have this robot inside .

Another explanation for the 4 times changing point (x,y)

position (x,y) = (0,0)
