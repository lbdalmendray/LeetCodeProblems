Idea :

The longest Valid Parentheses is the longest for each of the longest Valid parentheses that start at each index of the input string.

Then the new problem is what is the longest Valid Parentheses that start at index i ? ( i = 0, ..., s.Length-1).

The array solutions has all the solutions for each index . 
And A solution in Solutions[i] could depend of the Solutions[i+1] . The code explains the idea intuitively.
At the end of the algorithm
Solutions[i] == 0 tell us that there is no valid parentheses that starts at the index i .
