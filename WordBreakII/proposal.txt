I propose to add in the note list :

- s string just contains alphabetic characters .

- Each word in wordDict just contains alphabetic characters.      

There are similar cases that the default solution in Leetcode is not having a good answer . I think it is because the idea is that the s string does not have any white space . 
Try this case :

"cats anddog"
["cat","cats","and","sand","dog"]

expected answer by the default solution : [] 

In my opinion the expected answer should be : ["cats and dog"]
My expected answer is because the Statement says : "add spaces in s to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word" .
Adding a space after the substring "cats and" we obtain "cats and dog" that contains just words of wordDict. 


------ My Statement :

Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words,
add spaces in s to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word. 

-Return the amount of all such possible sentences.
-Return all such possible sentences.

Note:

- The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
- You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.
- s string contains just alphabetic characters .
- Each word in wordDict contains just alphabetic characters.
